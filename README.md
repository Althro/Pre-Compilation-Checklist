# Pre-Compilation-Checklist

Personal checklist for compiling via Wabbajack


## Meta Files

- Ensure .meta files are properly configured, refer to [Creating your own modlist](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack#creating-your-own-modlist)
- Ensure LOD files are whitelisted, if uploaded to Mega or GDrive

## Maintanance

- Delete old downloads of updated mods while updating your list
- Re-run behavior engines
- If mods updated, make sure there are no resolution errors in xEdit in your custom patches
- Maintain a changelog while working on the list, so things aren't forgotten, set date to `TBD`

## Compilation

- If using [this](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/wiki/Keeping-The-Game-Folder-Clean-(via-local-game-installs)) method to keep game folder files clean, ensure the ModOrganizer.ini is correct, keep a backup of the dev .ini to run the game on your local install
- Update either modlists.json or unlisted_modlist.json with new metadata after successful compilation
